Welcome to the first ANZ Cloud Native Bootcamp for 2020! 

** TODO Setting the scene

*** TODO Introductions

Firstly some quick introductions, my name is James Blair. I'm an Automation Lead at ANZ New Zealand based in Wellington. I've been in the tech industry for eight years, most of that working within government at Inland Revenue and joined ANZ a year ago.

To introduce this session, I first want to go back to a memory of my childhood, reading [[./images/goosebumps.jpg]] by R.L Stine. We all remember these right?

Ok so rest assured my goal for the session today isn't to scare you! However I am hoping we can go on something like an adventure, as we explore cloud native together, so what I've done is set this workshop up in a choose your own adventure style.
